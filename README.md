# WannaDoAProjectTogheterOrJustChat
Looking for someone to do a interessting project with or just to hang out


A bit about myself: I myself am working as a fulltime software developer and am looking for somebody to do things togheter with(Programm, playing games or just talking). I have plans to go study at the university soon(next 1 or 2 years) but first i want to make some money first. In my free time i love to read, play games, learn about programming or just talking with my friends. Recently i started picking up some outdoor activities like climbing but i also go to the gym for like 3 months already. I am a little shy but after i get to know people i am pretty open about myself.
